# Intro

In today's ever-evolving digital landscape, securing your organization's mobile,
web, and network assets is crucial to safeguarding sensitive information from
potential threats. Penetration testing serves as a vital component of
comprehensive cybersecurity strategies, enabling organizations to proactively
identify vulnerabilities and strengthen their defenses. This document outlines
Hacken's approach for multi-cloud, mobile, web, and network penetration
testing, providing a clear understanding of the benefits and outcomes these
assessments aim to achieve.

During the information security assessment, the Hacken team focuses on the
following goals and objectives:

- Identify technical and functional vulnerabilities.
- Estimate their severity level (ease of use, impact on information systems,
etc.)
- Modeling the "most likely" attack vectors against the Customer's
Information System.
- Proof of concept and exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- Draw up a prioritized list of recommendations to address identified
weaknesses.

# Security Assessment as Proactive Security

## 01 Multi-Cloud Penetration Testing: Fortifying Cloud Resilience across Platforms

Your cloud-based infrastructure acts as the backbone supporting your digital
operations. Our approach applies to the most popular cloud infrastructure
platforms such as GCP, AWS, Azure and others. With a combination of
automated tools for reviewing the environment's static configuration with
read-only access, manual testing and focus on proof of concept for each
potential attack vector from the perspective of an attacker who obtained an
initial foothold to your platform. Beginning with automated tools that
meticulously review the static configuration of your cloud infrastructure
platforms. By analyzing these settings with read-only access, we identify any
potential misconfigurations or security gaps, providing valuable insights into
your overall security posture.

Then the Hacken team conducts manual testing, leaving no stone unturned as
they probe your cloud environments. With a focus on common vulnerabilities
and emerging threats specific to cloud platforms, we identify weaknesses such
as misconfigured access controls, insecure API endpoints, and inadequate
encryption practices. Through this meticulous approach, we ensure
comprehensive coverage and uncover potential attack vectors that could
compromise your cloud security.

Throughout the penetration testing process, we prioritize the proof of concept
for each identified vulnerability. By simulating real-world attack scenarios, we
provide tangible evidence of the potential impact and consequences of an
exploited vulnerability. This allows you to fully comprehend the severity of the
risks and make informed decisions to effectively mitigate them. By fortifying the

## 06 Severity Scoring Scale

The severity level (criticality level) of each vulnerability is determined based on
the exploitation difficulty and the access level to an enterprise or end-user
information system an attacker can gain in case of successful exploitation. The
lower the exploitation difficulty level and the higher the access level which an
attacker can get, the higher the vulnerability severity level will be. The matrix
below illustrates the general methodology followed for identifying the severity
level of each finding:

![Severity Scoring Scale](./images/pentest-severities.png "Severity Scoring Scale")

To be the CVSS Compliant Hacken Team utilizes the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System CVSS values for each level of vulnerability, such a solution will
help prioritize the fixing vulnerabilities approach and make the results of the
Security Assessment more objective.

The table below fully describes each level of vulnerabilities and ties to CVSS

| Severity | CVSS | Description |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Informational | | This level refers to vulnerabilities that do not pose an immediate security risk or require exploitation. Instead, they provide valuable information or insights about the system's configuration, weaknesses, or potential areas for improvement. While they may not directly lead to a security breach, addressing these informational vulnerabilities can contribute to overall security enhancements and proactive risk mitigation efforts. |
| Low | **CVSS 0.1 - 3.9** | This level encompasses vulnerabilities with a low exploitation difficulty and low level of access. These vulnerabilities pose a relatively lower risk to the system's security as they are easier to exploit and grant minimal access privileges to potential attackers. While they still require attention and remediation, their impact is limited due to the restricted level of access gained. |
| Medium | **CVSS 4.0 - 6.9** | Vulnerabilities falling under this level have a moderate exploitation difficulty but the access level which can be gained by the attacker is greater compared to low-level vulnerabilities. They represent a medium level of risk to the system's security. Although they may be more challenging to exploit compared to low-level vulnerabilities, they still do not pose an immediate and severe threat. Appropriate measures should be taken to address these vulnerabilities promptly to prevent potential exploitation. |
| High | **CVSS 7.0 - 8.9** | Vulnerabilities categorized as high-level vulnerabilities have a low exploitation difficulty and grant a higher access level for the attacker in case of successful exploitation. These vulnerabilities pose a significant risk to the system's security and require immediate attention. While they may be more challenging to exploit, their potential impact is substantial. Timely remediation and mitigation measures should be implemented to address these vulnerabilities effectively. |
| Critical | **CVSS 9.0 - 10.0** | This level encompasses vulnerabilities with a low exploitation difficulty but the highest access level granted to the attacker in case of successful exploitation. These vulnerabilities are considered critical and pose the most severe threat to the system's security. Immediate action should be taken to remediate and address these vulnerabilities to prevent potential unauthorized access and significant security breaches. |
